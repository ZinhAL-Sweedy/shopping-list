* Wishlist:  
* known bugs: didn't finish the css styles and bootstrap but it is fine for me this I can do it anytime. didn't  setup the minimum (0)to the quantity so it will not go down.
 the most important thing for me do a complete and working system in limited time not the css. css is easy with bootstrap not like to figure the logic first in my priorities, order some products and need to finish and fix the paths for some pages or the links
* lessons learned:  create a  new application in one week, learned a new language, learned a new features with creating this application

* Wishlist:finish different functionality such as geo location (geocode_by :location (string)
after_validation :geocode) , payment with api and develop my search, put map to find stores places in the around area, develop my redirect paths, set minimum for quality, put the photo  to products and update the category model properties and add some columns, create menu and drop down lists, microphone from browser instead of typing the products and categories or search, finish the complete add comments to the code, make the table for viewing the results of the index and show page and add frame for the pages results (more css styles) such as quantity to show what product user choose and what is the price for one then the quantity* price then one row at the end of the table shows the total price or payment for that user. using partial view and make the code less(refactoring), search by the products for users also even if they dont login.
refactor my code by download of bootstrap file and include this on library and no need for gem any more and also working with no internet connection and no need for links, using pagenation for products and categories pages for big stores, use mobile implemations, add validation for emails
